/*When you build a database it is more convenient to store information in several tables. Indeed, it avoids redundancy, makes tables easier to maintain, and establishes the right connections between them.
Working on real projects, you will often need to use more than one table to get the information you want.

This is where JOINs come in. In theory, SQL join is a SQL (Structured Query Language) instruction to combine records from two tables based on a search condition.
Records are joined when the search condition evaluates to true. The resulting row consists of all the columns from both joined tables.
